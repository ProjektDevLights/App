### Description
DevLights are the smart home LED Stripes for Developers. This is one example application how the DevLights API can be used.
In the mobile application based on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) you can control and manage your DevLights.
Works on Android and iOS. Intended to use on Android because testing iOS apps without an Apple device is difficult.

### Prerequisites
Make sure that you have either npm or yarn installed. If you haven't than you can look [here](https://github.com/npm/cli) for npm, or [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) for yarn.

### Getting started
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ProjektDevLights/App.git
  cd App 
  yarn install 
  yarn start 
  yarn run android | yarn run ios
```
After running these few commands, your app on your device/emulator should start automatically, and you can start changing or adding things you want, so they will be applied immediately.
